# Classification-of-Capsule-Endoscopy-Images
This project aimed to classify capsule endoscopy images using 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the Kwasir Capsule dataset. 
Capsule endoscopy is a non-invasive procedure that allows physicians to 
examine the small intestine by swallowing a pill-sized capsule with a camera 
inside. Image classification is a challenging task due to the complexity and 
variability of the images captured by the capsule camera.
The Kwasir Capsule dataset is a publicly available dataset that contains mort 
than 47,000 images of the gastrointestinal tract, including normal and 
abnormal findings. The dataset was preprocessed and split into training, 
validation, and testing sets.
A CNN model was designed and trained on the training set using the Keras 
deep learning framework. The model was optimized using the Adam 
optimizer and evaluated using accuracy and other performance metrics such 
as precision, recall, and F1-score. The model achieved an accuracy of 
93.96% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying capsule 
endoscopy images
